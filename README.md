# Interactive Video Processing
In this project, I wanted to make video interactive. The scenario is: drops are falling until they reach the objects. 

To achieve that, we need to detect objects, we do it by background subtraction, After that, to remove noise I utilized two approaches, using binary threshold and finding contours(you can select one of them by 'mode' variable).

## Output
You can see the output below:
